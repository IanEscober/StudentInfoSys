A simple student enrollment system, it serves as the server for [StudenInfoSys-Client](https://github.com/IanEscober/StudentInfoSys-Client). It provides concise functionalities for viewing the students and their details. It also provides a trivial enrollment management system. It is designed to adehere to the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles. Anemic Domain Models were used for simplicity. [EFCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) provided database CRUD functionalities and [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) for mapping domain models to Dtos. Authentication composes of Basic and JWT Tokens. [Swagger/Swashbuckle](https://swagger.io/) was used for documenting the API.This project acts as backend training practice for a company.
